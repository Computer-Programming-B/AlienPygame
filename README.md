AlienPygame
===========
One of Python's great strengths is the number of useful libraries (like Turtle graphics) that are available. In this assignment we will use Pygame Zero, a game making library, to make a simple alien game.

Suggested steps to get started:
---------------------------------
1. It will be easiest to do this assignment on replit. Start by forking this [replit](https://replit.com/@MrSimonLowell/PygameAlienBase). If you prefer to work on your Windows PC using IDLE, see the instructions below, but be warned that installing Pygame will require using the command prompt.

Installing Pygame on a Windows PC running IDLE
----------------------------------------------
1. Installing Pygame on a Windows PC that uses IDLE is not straightforward. It requires using the command prompt to install the PyGame library. If you are comfortable with the command prompt, you will need to navigate to the `Scripts` folder where you installed Python 3. On my system I could navigate to the scripts folder with the command `cd \Program Files\Python39\Scripts`.
2. Now type the command `pip install pgzero`
3. This is what it looked like after I typed the command to install Pygame Zero

4. Pyganme and Pygame Zero are now succesfully installed. You can close the command prompt and start IDLE. If IDLE was open during the installation, you will need to close it and reopen it before you can start coding.
